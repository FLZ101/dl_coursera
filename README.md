Install the `dl_coursera` package in a virtual environment.

$ dl_coursera --version
```

Alternatively, you can download `dl_coursera` as a single executable from [https://github.com/FLZ101/dl_coursera/releases/](https://github.com/FLZ101/dl_coursera/releases/). **Note**:

* On Windows, SmartScreen may prevent execution of the executable

## How-to

1. Get the cookies file

   Sign into [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), then use a browser extension to export cookies as a cookies file which will expire in about two weeks.

   For Chrome/Edge/Firefox, you can use the **Cookie-Editor** extension.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check your network

2. Make sure you have enrolled in the specialization/course

3. If the cookies file might have expired, try getting a new one

4. Try upgrading to the latest version

5. Remove the directory `<output-directory>/<slug>/.cache` and try again

6. Visit [the issues page](https://github.com/FLZ101/dl_coursera/issues?q=is:issue). You may find a solution if others has encountered similar issues.

   Or you could create a new issue describing what is going wrong and the steps to reproduce it. Don't forget to attach the file `<output-directory>/<slug>/.cache/main.log` if it exists.
